Below is a description of the purpose of each script in this repository and what it does. This information is also included in the each of the scripts themselves.

  ### calculate_dff_aggregate
  Generates a single plot of mean % dF/F (average percent change in fluorescence intensity) over time. This plot contains traces from individual worm samples, as well as one thick black line showing the average across all worms tested.

  ### ConfidenceIntervalRibbon
  Generates a plot of mean % dF/F (average percent change in fluorescence intensity) over time. This plot contains only the average trace, which includes shaded ribbons as 95% CI.

  ### dff_heatmap
  Generates a normalizedheatmap of % dF/F (average percent change in fluorescence intensity) over time, where each row indicates responses from a single individual.
